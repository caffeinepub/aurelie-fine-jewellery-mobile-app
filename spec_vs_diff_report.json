  "summary": "All four requirements appear to be implemented in the diff. REQ-1 (label renames) is done in GenderCategoryTabs.tsx and page headings. REQ-2 (swipe-in animation) is implemented in BoysHomePage.tsx, GirlsHomePage.tsx, and index.css. REQ-3 (footer colour) is updated in FooterSystem.tsx. REQ-4 (category section relocation) is done by removing HeaderCategoryNav from Layout.tsx and embedding it only in GirlsHomePage.tsx. Animation CSS classes are referenced in the pages and the index.css file is modified, strongly implying the keyframe definitions are present. Overall implementation appears complete.",
