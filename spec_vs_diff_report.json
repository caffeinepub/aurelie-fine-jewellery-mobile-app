  "summary": "The diff implements all four requirements with good coverage. REQ-1 (icon-only cart), REQ-2 (filter panel), REQ-3 (recently viewed), and REQ-4 (shimmer border) are all present. However, there are some gaps: REQ-1 label removal is confirmed for ProductDetailPage but MasonryProductGrid is truncated so cart button text removal cannot be fully confirmed. REQ-2 uses a Sheet slide-over rather than a truly full-screen panel. REQ-4 shimmer class is applied to MasonryProductGrid, CategoryProductRow, NewArrivalsSection, and RecentlyViewedSection cards.",

      "requirement": "Remove 'Add to Cart' text label from MasonryProductGrid cart buttons",
      "reason": "The MasonryProductGrid diff is truncated and the cart button markup is not visible in the provided content, so removal of the text label there cannot be confirmed from the diff alone.",

      "reason": "The requirement states filters must immediately update the displayed products when the user returns to or closes the filter panel. The FilterPanel implements a local draft state pattern where changes are only committed on an explicit Apply click, adding an extra confirmation step not requested.",
