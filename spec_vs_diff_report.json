  "summary": "The diff implements all three requirements with reasonable fidelity. REQ-1 is confirmed removed in HomePage.tsx. REQ-2 is addressed in CategoryPageTemplate with both ProductFilterBar and HeaderCategoryNav. REQ-3 is implemented via the new CategoryProductRow component integrated into HomeCategoryCarouselsSection. One minor concern: the webkit scrollbar hiding in CategoryProductRow uses a CSS class selector (.category-product-row) but the div uses className 'flex gap-3 overflow-x-scroll' without that class, meaning the webkit scrollbar rule may not apply. The genderFilter is hardcoded to 'girls' in HomeCategoryCarouselsSection for all categories, which may not show products for all categories correctly.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "requirement": "No scrollbar visible on the row - the webkit scrollbar CSS rule targets '.category-product-row' class but the rendered div does not have that class applied, potentially leaving the webkit scrollbar visible in Chrome/Safari",
      "reason": "In CategoryProductRow.tsx, the injected style targets '.category-product-row::-webkit-scrollbar { display: none }' but the container div uses className='flex gap-3 overflow-x-scroll' without the 'category-product-row' class, so the webkit scrollbar hiding rule will not match the element in Chromium-based browsers.",

      "reason": "The build request says each row should show products belonging to the relevant category with no mention of a fixed gender filter. Hardcoding genderFilter='girls' for every category carousel row was not requested and may cause rows to appear empty for categories with products under other genders.",
