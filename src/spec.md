# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix category circle styling by removing rectangular backgrounds and adding glow animations, then enhance the footer with social media icons and policy links managed through the admin panel.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove rectangular background shapes from the scrollable product category circles below the header
- Apply glow effect animation to category circles that matches the animated beige body background
- Add Instagram, Facebook, and X social media icons to the footer with clickable links
- Create admin settings panel to manage social media URLs
- Add Privacy Policy, Shipping Policy, and Terms & Conditions links in the footer that navigate to separate detail pages

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see cleaner category circles with subtle glow animations on the home page. The footer will display social media icons linking to company profiles and policy links that open detailed information pages. Admins can update social media URLs through the admin settings panel.
