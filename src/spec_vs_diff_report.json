  "summary": "Most requested admin/customer pages and category editing scaffolding were added (new /orders, /admin/orders, /admin/categories/$categorySlug/edit, multi-image managers). However, the diff indicates the HomePage was changed (violating REQ-1), and the Admin Orders page does not show evidence of required cancel-with-reason and tracking assignment features (REQ-6). Several unrelated features also appear added (e.g., profile-based admin detection, print receipts, new category route).",
