  "summary": "Diff shows HomePage now renders a <HomeCarousel /> above the product catalog, but the diff does not include the HomeCarousel implementation or any evidence of the required carousel behaviors (autoplay, arrows, admin-managed slides/URLs). The diff also truncates before the product-card action buttons, so the requested 'Buy Now' text color change cannot be confirmed from the provided evidence. No header/footer files appear modified.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Restore the homepage product carousel so it is visible on the Home page and behaves as it did previously: 16:9 aspect ratio, auto-play enabled, horizontal slide transitions, and left/right navigation arrows, using admin-managed images and redirect URLs.",
      "reason": "HomePage now includes <HomeCarousel />, but the diff provides no implementation details for HomeCarousel (aspect-video/16:9 enforcement, autoplay, horizontal transitions, arrow controls, enabled-slide filtering, click-through to admin-configured redirect URLs). With only HomePage.tsx shown (and truncated), the acceptance criteria cannot be verified.",

      "requirement": "Update the 'Buy Now' button text color for product cards shown on the homepage to a dark bottle-green color for both customer and admin users, without changing header/footer.",
      "reason": "The HomePage.tsx diff is truncated before the button markup/classes, so there is no direct evidence that the homepage product-card 'Buy Now' button text color was changed to the dark bottle-green token/class (e.g., text-bottle-green-dark) and that it applies consistently for admin/customer viewers.",
