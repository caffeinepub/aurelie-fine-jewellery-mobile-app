  "summary": "The diff shows updates primarily to CSS theme variables in frontend/src/index.css and updates to documentation/state summary files. There is no clear evidence (in the provided truncated diff) of implemented global CSS overrides that force all Shadcn/Tailwind buttons to a shimmering gold background, nor evidence of a metallic silver button-label treatment, nor evidence that the global body text shimmer was changed from animated silver to static gold.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Update the global styling so every button across the app renders with a shimmering gold background (not navy/blue), overriding Tailwind/Shadcn button background classes, without editing immutable Shadcn UI component source files.",
      "reason": "The diff only shows changes to CSS custom properties (e.g., --primary, --background) in frontend/src/index.css. It does not show any explicit global button selectors/overrides (e.g., targeting button, .btn, [data-slot=\"button\"], .bg-primary, etc.) that would reliably override existing Tailwind/Shadcn button background classes across the app.",

        "frontend/src/index.css"

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Change button label text color to a metallic silver treatment on top of the shimmering gold button background, ensuring button text is not affected by global non-button text shimmer rules and remains readable (including icons).",
      "reason": "No button text/icon color rules are shown in the diff. The changes visible are limited to theme variables and do not demonstrate a global rule ensuring button label/icon colors are metallic silver and protected from global text styling.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/index.css"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Replace the current global shimmering silver body text effect with a shimmering gold text finish that is static (no animation) for non-button text across the app.",
      "reason": "The diff does not show any CSS related to the existing shimmering silver body text effect (e.g., gradient text, background-clip, keyframes/animation) or its replacement with a static gold gradient. Only color tokens are visible in the truncated index.css.",
