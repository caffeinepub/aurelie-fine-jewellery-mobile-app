  "summary": "The diff does not show an implementation of the requested logo-button-only style override in `frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx`. Instead, it modifies global styling/theme content and project metadata/summaries, which does not directly satisfy REQ-1 and introduces unrequested changes.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Remove the orange/gold button-style background behind the header logo/brand lockup by overriding the global button background styles for the logo button only (element with class `header-brand-btn` in `frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx`), including hover/focus/active states, without changing header background, logo sizing/scroll-compress behavior, or other header buttons’ styling.",
      "reason": "No diff content shows changes to `frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx` or any CSS targeting `.header-brand-btn` to make it transparent across default/hover/focus/active states. The only visible CSS change is in `frontend/src/index.css` (theme variables), which does not evidence a scoped override for the logo button.",
